Pixel-Pipe: An AI-Powered Media Analysis Platform built on a serverless, event-driven architecture with AWS and Terraform.

Pixel-Pipe is an architectural showcase of a modern, cloud-native application designed for resilience, scalability, and automation. It's an AI-powered media analysis platform that ingests images and processes them through a fully decoupled, event-driven pipeline on AWS using services like S3, Lambda, SQS, and SNS. The entire system, from the network to the application logic, is defined with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and deployed via a secure, automated CI/CD workflow, demonstrating a holistic approach to building and managing production-grade software.
